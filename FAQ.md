Organized TODO
--
- What are you working on?
   
   Currently I am learning Python and Web development by creating a Python utility that uses to JSON to manage a TODO list. 
- Why are you working on a TODO app?
   
   While there is no shortage of TODO applications and extensions, I always feel like there is something missing. The desire to create a custom TODO app that satisfies my needs as well as my desire to learn python are the two reasons I am working on the TODO utility.

Programming
--
- Why are you not programming X in Y fashion?

   If you think I am programming something in an odd way then please kindly let me know. I still have much to learn and I may not be aware of potential issues and current best-practices. Of course I may also be intentionally implementing something in a specific way for learning purposes.
   
- How do I get started with programming/developing?
   
   This is good question but a broad question and as such requires its own document to explain. Go [here](https://www.google.com) to learn more.
