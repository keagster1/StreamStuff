Organized TODO
--
- What are you working on?

    Currently I am learning Python and Web development by creating a Python utility that uses to JSON to manage a TODO list. 
- Why are you working on a TODO app?

    While there is no shortage of TODO applications and extensions, I always feel like there is something missing. The desire to create a custom TODO app that satisfies my needs as well as my desire to learn python are the two reasons I am working on the TODO utility.
