About Me
--
- What school did you go to for college?
   
   I went to the University of Illinois at Springifield for Computer Science. I graduated after 3.5 years of study. I do not currently have plans to go back.
   
- What is your current job?

   While I don't feel comfortable telling you the exact company I will tell you that I am currently in an entry level developer position for a fortune 500 company.
      
- Where do you live?

   United States of America
   
- What diet are you on?

   I have been on the Keto diet since April (took October/November off) and lost over 50 pounds. You can read [here]() for more information on the Keto diet. Feel free to ask me specific questions that you have about the Keto diet. I'm happy to talk about it.
   
- Why are you programming instead of going outside?

   I genuinly enjoy programming/project management and as such tend to spend alot of my time doing just that. I do have friends and I do go outside everyonce in a while but I always come back to the computer at some point.
   
- What are your career goals?

   Right now I have two seperate career goals.
   First, I want to become a manager at the company I work at.
      
      I'm hoping to achieve this within 5 - 10 years.
   Second, I want to create a company at some point that focuses on development (games, apps, etc.)
   
      I don't have a timeline for this although the sooner the better.
Organized TODO
--
- What are you working on?
   
   Currently I am learning Python and Web development by creating a Python utility that uses to JSON to manage a TODO list. 
- Why are you working on a TODO app?
   
   While there is no shortage of TODO applications and extensions, I always feel like there is something missing. The desire to create a custom TODO app that satisfies my needs as well as my desire to learn python are the two reasons I am working on the TODO utility.

Programming
--
- Why are you not programming X in Y fashion?

   If you think I am programming something in an odd way then please kindly let me know. I still have much to learn and I may not be aware of potential issues and current best-practices. Of course I may also be intentionally implementing something in a specific way for learning purposes.
   
- How do I get started with programming/developing?
   
   This is good question but a broad question and as such requires its own document to explain. Go [here](https://www.google.com) to learn more.
