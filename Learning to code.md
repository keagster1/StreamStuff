# Learning to Code

Prelude
--

This document is fairly thorough and not all of the information will relate to you so please feel free to jump around as needed.

Introduction
--

Computer Science is a very wide and deep field with seemingly endless topics, ideas, theories, and possibilities. Programming is the reason why millions of lines of data can be processed in seconds. It is the reason why many tasks can be automated. Every company in the world buys or creates software that performs many tedious tasks for them and people are always looking for the next big thing to improve their productivity even more. 

So it is understandable that you would be interested in being a creator of these technologies. There is good moneyin developing and lots of feel-good moments to be had. 

Starting From Scratch
--

Getting started is the most important part of your technical journey. I've seen many avoid computer science because they had a hard time grasping the basics. Well, like most complex things you cannot just simply jump in and expect everything to go smoothly. Properly setting your expectations will ensure that you go a lot further in this field. 

First things first, learn what programming is. Since you may be a complete beginner it is important to make sure that you actually understand what computer science and programming is. So read [this](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsComputerScience.html) to learn what Computer Science is, and read [this](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/Introduction/WhatIsProgramming.html) to learn what programming in general is. Feel free to go back to one of those pages and use the arrow keys at the bottom to read more.

Once you have a basic understanding of what Computer Science is, we can move on to learning to program.

Learning a Language
--

Before giving my two cents on which langauges you should learn, bare in mind that if you go to college they will teach a few popular ones. Actaully I'm not going to straight up tell you what to learn first because that is part of the fun. You can start anywhere, just make sure to take advantage of quality online resources.

I will tell you what some of the popular languages are and a few details about each.

Most Popular Modern Languages:
- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml)
  
  - Works out of the box. Just download Java and an IDE (I like Eclipse) and you are already good to go!
  - Lots of online help.
  - Good for desktop applications and web services.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)

  - Fun and versatile.
  - Can be very complex and hard to understand to a beginner due to libraries like AJAX and jQuery.
  - Good for website front end and back end. 
  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

  - difficult to setup at first (especially on Windows)
  - Good for websites, console applications, and even GUI applications.
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/introduction-to-the-csharp-language-and-the-net-framework)
  
  - Easy to learn due to Microsofts Visual Studio which includes a very, very good IDE. 
  - Lots of resources to help.
- [C++](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26184/c-programming-language)
  
  - Used for a lot of video game development.
  - One of the toughest languages to learn.
- [C](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/c1.htm)

  - Most operating systems are made with C!
  - Not as hard to learn as c++ but still rather difficult
